# clipboardporn
Swaps text from the Windows clipboard for random porn site urls.

This repo includes scripts for compilation into a single ".exe".

The script gets persistance, by copying itself into shell:startup.

Everytime the victim copies text into the clipboard, there's one in three chances that it will be replaced for a random porn site url.

There's over sixteen thousand porn sites url which may be picked.

Enjoy!
